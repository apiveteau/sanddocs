The Home page shows all your worbooks and workflows.

A workbook is a DataMa analysis, which can be using on one or multiple DataMa solutions. Each workbook is linked to a dataset.

You can create a new workbook by clicking the '+' card at the top left corner, or jump into a previously saved workbook from here.

You can also edit the name or description of a workbook, remove it, or lock it from there.

Locking a workbook just prevent one user to unwillingly edit or delete that workbook.
